# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Challenge
The length of a campaign does not contribute to its success or failure. The Median length of time for failed campaigns is 30, while the median length of time for successful campaigns is also 30. What does appear to contribute to the success or failure of a campaign is the campaignâ€™s launch date. Campaigns launched in May or June had a higher Success rate than those launched in the other months.
